        <h1><i>Hello World!</i></h1>

        <p>
            I am a student at 
            <u>FIRST</u>
            studying graphic design and web development. Whilst I have a general 
            understanding of the basics of code, this is definitley the 
            <b>most</b> 
            coding I've done. I think the last time I coded was late middle school/early highschool,
            when we would play around on basic coding websites, like <www class="code org">www.code.org</www>
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm so excited to learn more and see where this class takes me!
