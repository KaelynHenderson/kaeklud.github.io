        <p>
            I am a student at 
            <b>FIRST</b>
            studying 
            <u>graphic design and web development</u>. 
            Whilst I have a general understanding of the basics of code, this is definitley the 
            <b>most</b> 
            coding I've done. I think the last time I coded was late middle school/early highschool,
            when we would play around on basic coding websites, like 
            <i>www.code.org</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm so excited to learn more and see where this class takes me! My teachers have been such a
            big help.
