            I am (almost) 22 years old and  I was born in Des Moines, Iowa but I currenly live in Jacksonville, Florida. I've lived here most of my life, but I still like to tell people that Iowa will always be my home. I have a wonderful boyfriend and we have a cat-child named Bradley.

        <p class="paragraph-2">
            I have always had a deep interest in all things art. From incoherent scribbles when I was a child, to complex portraits when I entered high school, art has always held a place in my life. While I don't always finish my personal pieces, I constantly have a new idea forming in my mind; whether it be a digital painting, a quick sketch, or a logo for a made up company.
