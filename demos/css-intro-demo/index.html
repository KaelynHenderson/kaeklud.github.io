            <h1>Today we are learning CSS</h1>
            <i>and the blonde espresso shots I had earlier just caught up with me.</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p id="first-paragraph">
            We made a id for this paragraph and then on the CSS page, we made our color rule, which made this paragraph text turn blue!
            <br>
            (color: blue;) and then (background-color: lavender;) and then (font-style: italic;) and then (text-align: right;)
        </p>
        <p id="second-paragraph">
            We did the same thing with this paragraph, but instead of typing out the color we wanted, we used the hex code (#) within the rule.
            <br>
            (font-size: 25x;) and then (text-decoration: underline;)
        </p>
        <p id="bold-paragraph">
            Set another id in html, opened in CSS and made a rule 
            <br>
            (font-weight: bold;)
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="span1">We made this as span with id1</span>
            which basically highlights certain elements of a paragraph that we want to indivually change.
            <span id="span2">span with id2</span>
            it's just more CSS rules,
            <span id="span3">span with id3</span>.
            with more customizations
            <span id="span4">and then span with id4</span>
        </p>
